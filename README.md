## Welcome to the Scicerver Ocean Modelling User Case

[SciServer](http://www.sciserver.org/) consists of integrated Tools that work together to create a full-featured system.
SciServer is administrated by The Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science (idies) and The Johns Hopkins University, and is funded by National Science Fundation award ACI-1261715.

The Ocean Modelling User Case consists of a set of tools that provide access to numerical models outputs resulting from high resolution Ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs) set up by [Prof. Thomas W. N. Haine](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/haine/) group (Johns Hopkins University - Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences).

## Example
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/malmans2/JHU-MITgcm_Tools/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/malmans2/JHU-MITgcm_Tools/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
